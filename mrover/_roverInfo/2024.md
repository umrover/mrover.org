    - Perry was designed for mobility, precision, and mission success. Its lightweight aluminum chassis and rocker-bogie suspension ensure smooth navigation over rough terrain, while custom 3D-printed wheels provide traction and stability. The robotic arm, with five degrees of freedom, can lift up to 10kg and is controlled via inverse kinematics for intuitive operation. Powered by a 36V battery, the roverâ€™s modular electronics include custom PCBs and real-time monitoring for reliable performance. Communications use a 2.4 GHz wireless network, enabling data transfer at speeds up to 60 Mbps.

    - Autonomy is enhanced by RTK GPS and advanced object detection, with a GUI that provides camera views and a 3D model for precise control. The rover is designed for tasks like Delivery and Equipment Servicing, with capabilities like obstacle navigation and arm manipulation. Rigorous testing ensures robust performance across all systems, preparing the rover for the University Rover Challenge.

    - MRover placed 9th at URC and 2nd at CIRC this year!

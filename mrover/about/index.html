          MRover's primary goal is to win the University Rover Challenge (URC).
          Student teams from all over the world compete in the URC to design and build the best rover for assisting
          future astronauts.
          The URC is hosted by The Mars Society, the largest advocacy group for the exploration and settlement of Mars,
          and it takes place at the Mars Research Station in the Utah Desert.
          The competition consists of four events:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extreme Retrieval and Delivery - Traveling over tough terrain</li>
          <li>Equipment Servicing - Manipulating various pieces of equipment with the robotic arm</li>
          <li>Science - Acquiring soil samples from a chosen site and evaluating it for signs of life</li>
          <li>Autonomous Navigation - Driving to GPS coordinates and searching for markers nearby</li>
        </ul>

        CIRC is hosted by the Canadian Space Technology Advancement Group and takes place in Drumheller, Alberta. The
        competition consists of five events: 
        
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Boneyard Salvage - Assess the reactor site's location, damage, radiation and hazards</li>
          <li>Reactor Maintenance - Replace depleted reactor rods while managing temperature and coolant levels</li>
          <li>Arm Dexterity - Manipulating equipment and carrying cargo to service a lander</li>
          <li>Traversal - Autonomously locate stations and follow a trail of lights at night</li>
          <li>Mars Murder Mystery - Photograph a murder scene, scan ArUco tags, and return items</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Robotic Arm</h4>
            The Robotic Arm subteam designs and builds a five degree-of-freedom robotic arm responsible for
            completing tasks in the "Equipment Servicing" and "Extreme Retrieval and Delivery" portions of the
            competition. The arm is able to lift objects, open drawers, push buttons, type on a keyboard, and accomplish
            other precise movements.

            The Mobility subteam develops and builds the drive and suspension systems to
            navigate through rocks and rough terrain in each competition mission. They work
            to provide reliable driving and agile maneuvering, while also protecting sensitive
            onboard equipment from impacts and vibration.

            The Chassis and Mounts subteam develops a lightweight and strong chassis that is
            optimized for the integration of all our sub-systems. They also develop our gimbal
            camera for operation, physical enclosures for electrical components and
            wire management for a professional-looking rover.

            Science Payload Instrumentation subteam brings together our sensors and tests, 
            performing in-situ sampling. Their science box is able to perform on-board science
            and life-detection tests required for URC's Science Mission. The SPI system also has
            sensors for sampling the surrounding environment and external cameras to analyze rock formations.

            The Sample Acquisition subteam focuses on developing and testing the mechanics of soil collection.
            In 2025, the sample acquisition system consisted of a linear actuator-driven sheathed auger 
            collection system that drills into the ground, coring up to 10-cm deep, which then transports
            soil samples upwards and into the SPI system.

            past or present life. They research different indicators of life, identify possible tests for those
            indicators, and then work with the Science Payload Instrumentation subteam and others to make those tests
            work in real-time onboard the rover for URC. And the Astrobiology team conducts the tests themselves at CIRC
            (where onboard testing is not required).</p>

            <h4>Autonomy</h4>
            Our Autonomy team is further divided into 3 subteams: Navigation, Perception, and Localization.
            Navigation plans and executes a path for the rover to search an area while avoiding obstacles.
            Perception identifies key features of the environment (objective markers) and obstacles in the path.
            The roverâ€™s navigation system uses A* to path plan around obstacles for the autonomy mission. 
            The cost map grid is periodically centered on the rover to support obstacle avoidance over longer
            distances without needing a larger grid. Recent autonomy projects include working on integrating 
            inverse kinematics onto our rover's robotic arm.

            The Embedded Software subteam writes low-level driver code that allows the other programming subteams to
            utilize the electronic equipment on the rover. They work primarily with libraries in C and python, provided
            by manufacturers, to abstract the functions needed by the other teams for easy use.

            They maintain the GUIs used at the base station used to control the rover
            and view system metrics, as well as develop control solutions for complex
            systems (such as our robotic arm) to improve accuracy and usability.
            Disjointly, the Teleoperation subteam maintains and improves general software
            infrastructure such as our custom build system.

            The Drone subteam is developing a drone to be used in collaboration with the Rover
            during the delivery mission at URC. Our drone is capable of both manual and autonomous
            operation and can carry out tasks such as reading signs, locating objects, and acting
            as a backup communications link between the Rover and the team. This year's projects
            include improving the drone's communication systems, upgrading the mechanical structure
            to increase flight time, and adding custom autonomous capability for specific mission tasks.

        <p>
          MRover's primary goal is to win the University Rover Challenge (URC).
          Student teams from all over the world compete in the URC to design and build the best rover for assisting
          future astronauts.
          The URC is hosted by The Mars Society, the largest advocacy group for the exploration and settlement of Mars,
          and it takes place at the Mars Research Station in the Utah Desert.
          The competition consists of four events:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extreme Retrieval and Delivery - Traveling over tough terrain</li>
          <li>Equipment Servicing - Manipulating various pieces of equipment with the robotic arm</li>
          <li>Science Cache - Acquiring soil from a chosen site and evaluating it for signs of life</li>
          <li>Autonomous Navigation - Driving to GPS coordinates and searching for markers nearby.</li>
        </ul>

        CIRC is hosted by the Canadian Space Technology Advancement Group and takes place in Drumheller, Alberta. The
        competition consists of five events. Four are similar to the URC events and the fifth is a Search and Rescue
        task.

            The Robotic Arm subteam designs and builds a multiple degree-of-freedom robotic arm responsible for
            completing tasks in the "Equipment Servicing" and "Extreme Retrieval and Delivery" portions of the
            competition. The arm is able to lift objects, open drawers, push buttons, type on a keyboard, and accomplish
            other precise movements.

            tests detecting
            signs of life onboard the rover; additionally, the ISH sub-system sends information back to Astrobiology
            members to effectively
            analyze rock compositions and types.

            The Autonomy subteam develops high-level, abstracted code that allows the rover to traverse
            desert terrain and reach desired waypoints, avoid obstacles, and search for field markers. They also work
            closely with the Perception team and employ GPS, magnetometers, IMUs, and other sensors to achieve the
            goals of autonomous traversal. Our Navigation subteam falls within Autonomy.

            and view system metrics, as well as develop control solutions for complex
            systems (such as our robotic arm) to improve accuracy and usability.
            Disjointly, the Teleoperation subteam maintains and improves general software
            infrastructure such as our custom build system.

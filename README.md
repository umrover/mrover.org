# mrover.org
Jekyll Powered site for the University of Michigan Mars Rover Team

### Development Setup

If you are on Mac or Linux, simply follow this installation [guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

If you are on Windows, use this installation [guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/).  
- If you use the Ruby Installer for Windows, you will have to run the production build command from Git Bash or a similar program
- If you install Jekyll using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you will have to run the bash command from Powershell to enter a bash prompt and run jekyll commands.

### Updating the Rovers Page

The content of the Rovers page is controlled by the .md files in the _roverInfo folder. The images for this page can be stored anywhere, although for the purpose of organization, we keep them in the rovers/roverImages folder.

The .md files in the _roverInfo folder contain data in a YAML frontmatter (surrounded by "---"). Use any text editor to modify this data.

To add a rover to this page, simply any of the .md files from a previous year and edit the data inside. Then, rebuild the site for production and push to Github.

### Testing the site

To test the site, simply navigate to the`/mrover` folder and run

    jekyll serve

You can connect to the site by opening your browser and navigating to localhost:4000. Any changes that you save will automatically trigger jekyll to rebuild the site. You can see these changes by refreshing the page.

### Building the site for production
To build the site for production, navigate to the `/mrover` folder and run

    JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build
    
Once you push to Github, Github Pages will automatically deploy the content in the /docs/ folder of the repository.

If the site is note appearing, make sure there is a file called `CNAME` (no file extension) that contains the text `mrover.org` to the docs folder.

### Note
Do not edit the .html or .css files in the `/docs` folder directly. These are generated by Jekyll.

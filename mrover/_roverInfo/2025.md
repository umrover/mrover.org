    - This year's rover was extensively redesigned to overcome previous challenges and enhance performance across all mission areas. Key improvements include a lightweight torsion box chassis, a novel double-lambda rocker-bogie suspension for better obstacle handling, and upgraded 3D-printed wheels with custom gearboxes for improved mobility. The five-degree-of-freedom robotic arm features two new end effectors and increased durability for harsh conditions. A new electronics architecture centralizes power and control through custom PCBs, while the Jetson AGX Orin enables advanced autonomy, including object detection, visual servoing, and RTK GPS-based navigation. The science system introduces a sheathed auger for soil collection and dual life-detection assays, supported by environmental sensors and geological imaging.
    - Kiwi earned 11th place at URC and 12th place at CIRC.

    - Grover featured many designs that would be signatures of MRover for the next few years. 
        The six-wheeled rocker-bogie mechanism allowed the rover to remain stable on uneven terrain, and the rectangular chassis
        allowed the electronics to be housed in the back and the subsystems in the front.
    - With an entirely new set of programmers, it was decided that the previous year's software was outdated and that the best move was to start
        from scratch. Starting with a simple set of programs for encoding joystick data at the base station and decoding it onboard the rover, our programmers began developing code that would be used in future years and learning lessons in developing a maintainable codebase.

        Grover did not qualify to compete in URC 2015.

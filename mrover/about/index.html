    <h3>The Challenge</h3>

        <p>
          MRover's primary goal is to win the University Rover Challenge (URC).
          Student teams from all over the world compete in the URC to design and build the best rover for assisting
          future astronauts.
          The URC is hosted by The Mars Society, the largest advocacy group for the exploration and settlement of Mars,
          and it takes place at the Mars Research Station in the Utah Desert.
          The competition consists of four events:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extreme Retrieval and Delivery - Traveling over tough terrain</li>
          <li>Equipment Servicing - Manipulating various pieces of equipment with the robotic arm</li>
          <li>Science Cache - Acquiring soil from a chosen site and evaluating it for signs of life</li>
          <li>Autonomous Navigation - Driving to GPS coordinates and searching for markers nearby.</li>
        </ul>

        The teams must be able to maneuver their rovers through the unpredictable, rocky terrain using only the cameras
        on their rovers, simulating the experience of driving a rover on Mars.
        In light of recent interest in autonomy, the URC implemented an autonomous navigation task in 2017, adding an
        additional software challenge to the competition.

            <h4>Robotic Arm</h4>
            The Robotic Arm subteam designs and builds a multiple degree-of-freedom robotic arm responsible for
            completing tasks in the "Equipment Servicing" and "Extreme Retrieval and Delivery" portions of the
            competition. The arm is able to lift objects, open drawers, push buttons, type on a keyboard, and accomplish
            other precise movements.

            differential systems, compliant wheels with custom tread, flexible 3D printing, and 4-bar linkage 
            shock suspensions. (Not accepting new members in Winter 2020)

            selecting equipment to monitor for evidence of life around the rover. They research different indicators of
            life, identify a possible test for that indicator, and then design a way for the test to happen on board the
            rover in partnership with Instrumentation and Sample Handling as well as Sample Acquisition.

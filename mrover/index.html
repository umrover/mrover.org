                <h4>Who we are</h4>
                <p>The Michigan Mars Rover Team (MRover) is a student-run, multidisciplinary organization whose mission is to
                    design and build a rover for the exploration of extraterrestrial environments. Our team consists of everyone from freshman to graduate students, representing majors from the 
                    College of Engineering and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. We strive
                    to inspire and educate students about space, Mars exploration, and engineering, and we focus
                    on helping students grow as engineers.

                <h4>What we do</h4>
                <p>As a competition-oriented team, our goal is to win the annual University Rover Challenge
                    (URC) at the Mars Society's Mars Desert Research Station near Hanksville,
                    Utah. The competition has gained worldwide attention from academia and industry, and teams from all over
                    the globe come to compete. This past summer, URC hosted 36 teams from fifteen countries. MRover
                    secured 11th place at the competition!</p>
